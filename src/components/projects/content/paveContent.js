              Some of them, a lot of them, aren't posted by the people they
              advertise. They're posted by a human trafficker, who makes the
              decisions about who their victims see, how often they work, and
              for how much. Often the trafficker is part of a larger operation,
              that shuffles victims from city to city in order to keep them
              isolated and dependent. Operations like that take steps to obscure
              themselves . The problem is, so does every voluntary sex worker.
              It's dangerous, and not just because it's usually illegal.

              The challenge then is to sift through mountains of intentionally
              confusing information in order to identify likely human
              trafficking rings. That way, investigative effort can be focused
              on bringing traffickers to justice, instead of targeting
              clandestine but otherwise innocuous sex workers. That's what LEADS
              does, which has been my focus for the past few years.

              I was tasked with designing the user interface and developing the
              frontend using React and Material UI. I saw the project through
              initial brainstorming meetings all the way to production release.
              LEADS is now being used across the country, by organizations like
              Homeland Security and state taskforces, and has already proven
              itself a valuable tool in taking down real trafficking operations.
              It was a monumental undertaking, but the amount of personal growth
              I experienced as a result, not to mention the satisfaction in
              making a real-world impact, was well worth it.
